[10:42:43] ERROR: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered
Search for `cudaErrorAssert' in https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__TYPES.html for more information.
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.
